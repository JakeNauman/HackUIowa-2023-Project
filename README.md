## Inspiration
Combining astronomy, education, and large language models

## What it does
Planetalk allows you to chat with the sun or any planet in our system using the power of GPT3.5. You can ask it any from planet composition to the history of its discovery. Explore and learn about our solar system in a personal way, choose from 1 from 5 education levels to get varying levels of complexity.

## How we built it
Our web application was built using Django for our backend, Openai for large language model integration, and React and JavaScript from our frontend experience.

## Challenges we ran into
During development, we ran into a few roadblocks, the first of which was building the API channels needed to connect our Django backend to the React frontend. This also includes the testing of the input and outputs of the planet chat bot functionally. Additionally, we ran into a lot of small CSS formatting issues which slowed development.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are most proud of getting to such a polished state. We set out with a fairly simple idea but expanded on it and implemented several wish list features such as different education levels along with improved visuals. The visuals are where we are most proud from the custom images to the subtle gradients. 

## What we learned
We learned a lot about large language models, specifically Openai's GPT3.5. As well as React, a new technology for both of us.

## What's next for Planet-Talk
A future update may include more variety, such as moons of different planets or whole new galaxies. Additionally, we may upgrade the existing planet selection to show the planets in orbit in a 2.5D solar system visual.
